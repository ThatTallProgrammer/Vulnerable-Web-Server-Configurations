Directory listing occurs when an attacher is able to send a specially crafted request that lists the directory structure of the web server

::: Apache :::
Occurs when no default file is specified for a directory

Setup
  - Create a test directory in /var/www/html
  - Create multiple files and/or other directories in the test directory
  - Navigate to the test directory in a browser. The files will be listed.

::: Remediation :::

Configure the system to server indexing of directories\

1. httpd.conf
  - Find the line with "Options Indexes FollowSymLinks"
  - Change to "Options FollowSymLinks"
  - Restart the server
  - Verify that browsing to the test directory gets a Forbidden status

2. .htaccess
  - Ensure that "AllowOverride All" is specified in the main configuration file
  - Create a .htaccess file in the main html directory (/var/www/html)
  - Place "Options -Indexes" in the file
  - Restart the server
